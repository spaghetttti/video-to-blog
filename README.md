## Overview

This Next.js application is a frontend web application built using React.js and Next.js framework. It provides a modern, efficient, and scalable solution for building web applications with server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js enables server-side rendering, allowing faster initial page loads and improved SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Next.js supports static site generation, generating static HTML files at build time for optimal performance.
- **Routing:** Next.js provides a simple and intuitive routing system, allowing easy navigation between pages.
- **API Routes:** Next.js allows the creation of API routes for serverless functions, enabling seamless integration with backend services.
- **CSS-in-JS:** Next.js supports CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or CSS modules for styling components.
- **Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically splits code into smaller chunks, improving page loading times and reducing initial bundle sizes.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** Next.js provides built-in support for Hot Module Replacement, allowing developers to see changes in real-time without full page reloads during development.
- **TypeScript Support:** Next.js has built-in TypeScript support, enabling static typing for enhanced developer productivity and code quality.
